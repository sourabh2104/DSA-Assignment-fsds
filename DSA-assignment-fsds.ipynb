    "Explanation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening a multilevel doubly linked list involves restructuring the list to make it a single-level doubly linked list while maintaining the order of elements. The provided Python implementation employs a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to achieve this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS Traversal: The process begins with a depth-first traversal of the multilevel doubly linked list. A stack is utilized to keep track of the next levels during the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening Levels: For each node in the traversal, the algorithm checks if the node has a child. If a child exists, the algorithm pushes the next level (i.e., the node's sibling) onto the stack and sets the child pointer to None, effectively detaching the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting Nodes: After handling the child, the algorithm ensures proper connection of nodes within the current level. Specifically, it checks whether the current node has a sibling (next node). If the node lacks a sibling but there are levels left in the stack, the algorithm connects the last node in the current level to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Management: The stack plays a crucial role in managing the traversal through different levels. When a child is encountered, the corresponding next level is pushed onto the stack. When the current level is exhausted, the algorithm pops the next level from the stack to continue the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop Termination: The algorithm continues this process until it reaches the end of the linked list, ensuring all levels are flattened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Edge Cases: The algorithm accounts for various edge cases, such as an empty linked list or a node without a child. It also checks if the traversal is unnecessary, as in the case of a single-level doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection Adjustments: For each level, the algorithm updates the next and prev pointers to connect nodes in a doubly linked manner. If there's no sibling but the stack holds the next level, the last node in the current level connects to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node Representation: The Node class encapsulates the properties of a node in the doubly linked list, including its value, pointers to the previous and next nodes, and a pointer to a child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing Functionality: The provided code includes a helper function, print_doubly_linked_list, to visually verify the linked list structure before and after flattening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage: The algorithm is demonstrated using an example multilevel doubly linked list, showcasing the original structure and the flattened result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: The original multilevel doubly linked list is visualized with nodes connected horizontally as siblings and vertically as children, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening Logic: The algorithm's logic is highlighted, emphasizing the steps taken during traversal, connection adjustments, and stack management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Implementation: The code leverages Python for its simplicity and readability. The use of a class (Node) facilitates encapsulation and organization of node properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency Considerations: While the algorithm's time complexity is influenced by the depth-first traversal, the use of a stack helps manage the levels efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification: The final flattened doubly linked list is printed and visually inspected, confirming the successful execution of the algorithm and the proper reconstruction of the list in a single-level format.\n",

    "Initial Conditions: The algorithm begins by checking for edge cases, ensuring the linked list is not empty or contains only a single node, as rearrangement is not necessary in such cases.\n",

    "Node Separation: The linked list is traversed node by node, and during each iteration, nodes are categorized based on their position. Two separate linked lists are maintained—one for odd-positioned nodes and another for even-positioned nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "List Pointers: For both odd and even lists, two pointers are employed to keep track of the current node being processed and another to construct the linked list for the respective positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversal Logic: The traversal involves alternating between odd and even positions. If the current node is at an odd position, it is added to the odd list; otherwise, it is added to the even list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Position Tracking: A boolean variable (is_odd) is used to toggle between odd and even positions during the traversal. This variable determines the destination list for each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odd and Even Head Nodes: Separate head nodes (odd_head and even_head) are maintained for the odd and even lists to facilitate list construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting Lists: Once all nodes are categorized into odd and even lists, the odd list is connected to the even list to form the rearranged linked list. The even list is terminated with a None pointer to indicate the end of the list.\n",

    "Resultant List: The resulting linked list is now rearranged according to the specified pattern, with odd-positioned nodes preceding even-positioned nodes.\n",

    "Initialization:\n",
